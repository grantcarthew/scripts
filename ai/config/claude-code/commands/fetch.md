# Fetch with MCP

Please retry the previous request, but this time use the MCP fetch server tools instead of the built-in WebFetch tool. 

Use one of these MCP tools:
- `mcp__fetch__fetch_markdown` for Markdown output
- `mcp__fetch__fetch_html` for raw HTML 
- `mcp__fetch__fetch_txt` for plain text (HTML stripped)
- `mcp__fetch__fetch_json` for JSON content

Choose the most appropriate format for the request. If no specific format was mentioned, prefer `mcp__fetch__fetch_markdown` for web content.
