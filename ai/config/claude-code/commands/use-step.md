## Methodical Approach Protocol

Apply systematic step-by-step methodology to ensure thorough and organized problem solving.

### Process Rules

1. **Single Step Focus**: Present only one step at a time
2. **Completion Confirmation**: Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Provide just enough information to complete current step
4. **Sequential Progress**: Move to next step only after current step completion
5. **Adherence Requirement**: Strictly follow this step-by-step approach

### Step Structure

Each step will include:

- **Objective**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Actions**: Specific tasks to perform
- **Expected Outcome**: What success looks like
- **Verification**: How to confirm completion

### Benefits

- **Ensures Thoroughness**: Nothing gets skipped
- **Maintains Focus**: Clear current objective
- **Enables Recovery**: Easy to backtrack if needed
- **Builds Confidence**: Regular completion milestones

## Task Breakdown Process

1. **Analyze the overall task**: Understand the complete scope
2. **Identify major phases**: Break into logical sections
3. **Define sequential steps**: Order tasks by dependencies
4. **Present first step**: Begin with the initial action
5. **Await confirmation**: Wait for step completion before continuing

## Step Presentation Format
