## Document Driven Development (DDD)

This project uses Document Driven Development. Design decisions are documented in Design Records (DRs) before implementation.

**For complete DR writing guidelines:** See [docs/design/dr-writing-guide.md](docs/design/dr-writing-guide.md)

**Location:** `docs/design/design-records/`

**Quick reference:**

- Create DRs for: Architectural decisions, algorithms, breaking changes, API/CLI structure
- Get next DR number from: `docs/design/design-records/README.md`
- Follow reconciliation process after 5-10 DRs (see dr-writing-guide.md)
