## About Design Records

Design records capture the "why" behind technical decisions. They document:

- The problem being solved
- The decision made
- The reasoning behind it
- Trade-offs accepted vs gained
- Alternatives considered

See the dr-writing-guide.md in ~/Projects/ddd-template/.ai/design/ for authoring guidance.
